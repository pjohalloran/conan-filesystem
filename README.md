# conan-filesystem
 Packaging the filesystem (https://github.com/wjakob/filesystem) library for the Conan package manager (http://conan.io)

## Notes
- Package tested and known to work on OSX so far. Hopefully it will also work on other platforms, but pull requests are very welcome if not.
- Releases of filesystem are not tagged at present. Can talk to author if anybody needs this but so far i have not myself. This conan package always points to the latest of filesystem on the master branch as a result (even though conanfile states its v1.0).
